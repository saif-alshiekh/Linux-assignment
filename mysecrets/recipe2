1 lb ground beef
1 egg
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
Optional:

Cheese slices
Lettuce
Tomato slices
Pickles
Ketchup
Mustard
Mayonnaise
How:

In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, egg, breadcrumbs, onion, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.
Mix well until all ingredients are evenly combined.
Shape the mixture into burger patties (about 4-5 patties).
Heat a frying pan or grill on medium heat.
Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked.
